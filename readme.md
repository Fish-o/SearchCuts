# SearchCuts 

Super Easy Actions, Really Clever Hacks, Creates Ultimate Time-Savers

## Whats this?

It's me messing around with the gnome search-provider api, and hooking that up to do all sorts of things. It's needlessly complex, but works! It uses Gemini 2.0, so make sure you store a valid api key in the `GEMINI_API_KEY` env variable. 

Currently, it has the following shortcuts configured:

- `0t [text]` Translates text between english and dutch.
- `0a [text]` Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite to type out a word or sentence that fits your description.
- `0smart [text]` Same as above, but using the experimental Flash 2.0 thinking model. 



## Can you use this?

Probably not lol, this whole project is hacked together. If you're very interested then open an issue so I can help and create some installation instructions.
